
'Performing model evaluation in Python typically involves using a combination of libraries and techniques to assess how well a model is performing on your data. In this guide, I will walk you through a common process using scikit-learn, which is a popular machine learning library in Python. The process includes splitting the data into training and test sets, training a model, and using various evaluation metrics to assess performance.

#Step 1: Import Required Libraries

# Importing necessary libraries
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, precision_score, recall_score, f1_score, confusion_matrix, classification_report
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier  # Example model

#Step 2: Load Your Data

# Example: Load your dataset (replace this with your actual dataset)
# df = pd.read_csv("your_dataset.csv")

# For demonstration, we'll use the Iris dataset
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
data = load_iris()
X = pd.DataFrame(data.data, columns=data.feature_names)
y = pd.Series(data.target)


#Step 3: Split the Data

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

#Step 4: Train a Model

# Train a Random Forest model
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

#Step 5: Make Predictions

# Make predictions on the test set
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

#Step 6: Evaluate the Model

#1. Accuracy Score

# Accuracy score
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy:.4f}")

#2. Confusion Matrix

# Confusion Matrix
conf_matrix = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)
print("Confusion Matrix:")
print(conf_matrix)
